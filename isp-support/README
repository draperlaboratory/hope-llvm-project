Best results obtained by using the gold linker.  Your ld is likely a symlink, 
point it at ld.gold

To build the llvm riscv cross compiler first make sure that you have a riscv
toolchain installed.  I worked with the instructions here for a clean riscv
toolchain:

https://github.com/lowRISC/riscv-llvm

Then run the configure script.  I *strongly* recommend you let it install the
same version of cmake and ninja that I was using (the latest release as of May
22, 2018).  It will also ask you for the base path to the riscv toolchain.  This
will enable the cross compiler to actually work, and is where the cross compiler
will get installed.

./configure.sh

After that, you can build either the debug or release version.  I have been
working with the debug version during development, and strongly recommend it.
The release version is currently *untested* and *unsupported*.  

cd debug-build
ninja
ninja install
